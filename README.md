# SPAWN A REACT APPLICATION RIGHT NOW
My React Starter Kit, a strange mix of React, JSX, ES7 (Babel), ESLint, React-Hot-Loader, nothing safe for production!

But, if you're crazy like me, let's put that in production :)!
Awesome stack makes awesome app!

To install the deps, just npm install.
To start the server, just npm start.

## Composition of all this starter kit (without gluten):

* React.
* ES7 because [stage 0](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/) sounds too cool to be disabled.
* [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) (with [ESLint Plugin React](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react)) to prevent the code to explode during production.
* [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) because damn! AWESOMENESS OVER 9000.
* [React Router](http://rackt.github.io/react-router/) because routing is a serious job.
* [Alt](http://alt.js.org/), simple, terse, expressive.
* [AutobahnJS](http://autobahn.ws/js/), if this is the first time you hear about [WAMP](http://wamp.ws/), you should definitely try. Adieu REST API!
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) because it's simply awesome. All hail Webpack (and GitHub).
* [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) because PostCSS really makes CSS enjoyable!
* [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) because I believe that my tests will pass when I have KARMA (without using _Volkswagen_ techniques).
* [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) because it is a pretty awesome framework in my opinion.
* [Expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) because I want to become a better writer in the assertion field.
* [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) because I want to ship "consistency, modularity, performance, & extras" especially when I do Netscape's JavaScript.
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) because you would not write CSS with a "Can I Use" table. You love automation.

## TODO:

* Babel polyfills, Babel runtime and others things that are related to Browser support.
